## üì¶ System Overview

This system is built around the **ESP32Tang SOM**, consisting of:

- **ESP32-S3-WROOM-1** (MCU)
- **GOWIN GW1NR-LV9** (FPGA)

The two devices communicate via **1x SPI bus**, with dedicated interfaces for ADC (I¬≤C), CAN (SPI), and Ethernet (SPI).

## üß† Functional Description

### ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 (MCU)
- Main controller responsible for:
  - System logic
  - Communication protocol handling
  - Output command generation
- **Connectivity:**
  - Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
  - 1x SPI to external Ethernet PHY (e.g. W5500)
- **Fault Handling:**
  - Captures 8x DO fault signals via GPIO using DMA or interrupt
- **SPI Master Role:**
  - Communicates with FPGA to:
    - Read DI, ADC, CAN bus status
    - Send commands for DO, PWM, and analog outputs

---

### GW1NR-LV9 (FPGA)
- Acts as co-processor with real-time IO control logic
- SPI slave interface to ESP32-S3
- Handles:
  - **8x Digital Inputs (DI)**
  - **8x Digital Outputs (DO)**
  - **4x PWM Outputs**
- Manages external **ADS1115** (or ADS1015) via I¬≤C for analog input
- Communicates with **MCP2515 + CAN transceiver (e.g. MCP2551)** over SPI for CAN 2.0 protocol support
